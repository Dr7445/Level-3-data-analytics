<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Explain the role of data in the context of a digital world</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a world where we are becoming ever more reliant on technology ,data and the collection, organisation, processing, visualisation and understanding of it ,is not only beneficial but critical to the efficiency and advancement of modern civilization.</p>
<p>However first in order to understand the role of data in the modern digital world, we have to understand what data is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a common misconception that data IS information but data in and off itself doesn't necessarily give us any useful information with context, data is simply the raw, unprocessed and unorganised representation of information.</p>
<p>Therefore data has to go through a process that enables information to be gathered from it ,ergo data must be processed before it can be considered information, that can be given context, can be analyzed and can be visualized in order to tell a story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The digital era a new frontier!</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we understand what data is we can explore it's role in the context of a digital world.</p>
<p>From local to global governments, healthcare institutions, education establishments, banks, to businesses both large and small, data plays a crucial part in -</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Information gathering and storage</li>
<li>Data driven decision making</li>
<li>Innovation and research</li>
<li> Personlisation.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information gathering and storage:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>From smart devices to social media , financial transactions and manifold other sources, data can generated and gathered to then be stored in a multitude of different forms, such as databases , spreadsheets, documents and cloud based platforms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data driven decision making:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Something we are all familiar with due to the COVID pandemic! data driven decisions are derived from the analysing and visualisation of data that entities can use to  identify patterns, trends and behaviors that can help to make more informed decisions and develop better processes, protocols and strategies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Innovation and research:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Data acts as the foundation and building blocks to innovation and research.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The analyzation of data in scientific and research fields can lead to new discoveries, deeper understanding and breakthroughs in medicine, artificial intelligence, weather forecasting and climate change to name but a few.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personlisation:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Data gives businesses and services the ability to curate more personalised experiences for consumers that can be used to give more tailored content, recommendations and advertisements that are based on the individuals unique preferences and behavior patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The glue that binds:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>From IoT (internet of things) devices to user interactions, social media and artificial intelligence data is the glue that binds every facet of our digital lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most of us now own smart devices to control various appliances in the home and even our cars all of which collect data to allow for greater efficiency, convenience , automation and control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are constantly interacting with digital platforms and every time we do this generates data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From clicking on links, to the tap of a like button, the filling out of forms, to search engine use, actions performed on our devices ,the websites we look at , the social media we consume and the apps we use all generate data through our interactions with them that give insights in to our behaviour, improve the overall user experience and give more curated and personalised content .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every facet of the modern and increasingly digital world is held together with the data it generates to improve and enhance life in the 21st century and beyond!</p>
