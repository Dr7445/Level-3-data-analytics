<h2><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> Explain the functions and purpose of data formats and explain the importance of selecting the appropriate data format for data analysis .<br /></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Data formats refers to the Structural form a data file is assigned when it is created and how it is stored and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"> can be exported in a way that makes it readable by whatever software  it is intended for, such a s a .SQL file for SQL software, Xl. for excel software, JSON for web API's and real time data and so forth.<br /><br />The type of format used depends on the type of data being stored, below we can see an example of the various types of data and the formats that could be used to store them.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Data types and their formats:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Numeric integers:</strong> Data that consists of whole numbers only (can be formatted as CSV, JSON, XML, SQL , XL)</li>
<li><strong>Temporal:</strong> Data that consists of time and dates (can be formatted  as CSV, JSON. XML,XL, SQL)</li>
<li><strong>Text:</strong> Alphanumeric characters which can consist of letter, numbers and symbols. (TXT, CSV, LOG, HTMK, XML, JSON)</li>
<li><strong>Geospatial:</strong> Which includes information about locations such as maps and coordinates. (GeoJSON, KML, SQLite)</li>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> Stored as video (MP4, MoV etc), image (Jpeg, PNG, GIF) or audio files (Mp3).</li>
<li><strong>Logical:</strong> Boolean data (Binary data type that that only has one of 2 possible values such as True or False).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /><br /><br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;">When data is stored, it is important to select the appropriate format.<br /><br />For example, data that consists mainly of text to be read should be stored in a format such as a txt. file or pdf. file.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Selecting the correct format for the dataset ensures consistency, data that contains for example customer names, customer id's, sales, etc. could be saved as a plain .TXT file but this format would not  be suitable for the data where as a .CSV or .SQL format would allow the customer data to be structured in a more suitable way using tables with row and columns that will make the data more readily accessible and will allow it to be cleaned, queried and manipulated with the correct software.<br /><br />It' is therefore of great importance that the correct format is selected for the dataset so that the necessary information can be extracted from it.<br /><br />The correct data format also allow for efficiency, speed and optimisation, this is of particular importance for "Big" datasets where large amounts of data may need to be compressed to reduce the size of the files in order for the data to be stored more efficiently and to be imported/exported at faster speeds.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Summary:</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The purpose of data formats is to enable data to be stored, retrieved and analysed in an efficient  manner that is compatible with the software it is to be analysed  with . Therefore it is important that the correct format is selected so that the data can be processed in a way that makes the most sense for the data contained within. </span></p>
