<h2><span class="wrapper"><span>Explain the</span></span><span> importance of manipulating and linking different dataset</span><span class="wrapper"><span>s</span></span></h2>
<p><span class="wrapper"> </span></p>
<p>Manipulating and linking <span class="wrapper">dataset</span> allows <span class="wrapper">for</span> raw, <span class="wrapper">fragmented</span> or siloed data to form part of <span class="wrapper">an</span> holistic <span class="wrapper">whole</span> which enables deeper insights and simplifies collaboration and communication across an organisation.</p>
<p>There are <span class="wrapper">manifold</span> ways to manipulate and link data <span class="wrapper">together including.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Application <span class="wrapper">programming interface</span> (API): APIs facilitate the seamless flow of data from various <span class="wrapper">sources that</span> can be integrated <span class="wrapper">in to</span> the data architecture in <span class="wrapper">real time.</span> This allows for more fluid and responsive <span class="wrapper">data driven</span> decisions by ensurin<span class="wrapper">g da</span>ta is <span class="wrapper">up to date</span> and <span class="wrapper">consistant.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="wrapper">Fuzzy matching: Allow for linking through datasets of words that are similar matches but have variations in spellings or contain spelling mistakes, for example</span> in my linking <span class="wrapper">project</span> I used fuzzy matching on church dioceses to find variations of the same <span class="wrapper">dioceses</span> such as <span class="wrapper">Saint Albans</span> and <span class="wrapper">St.Albans.</span> Fuzzy matching is an important part of the cleaning and merging <span class="wrapper">process particually</span> where user <span class="wrapper">inout</span> could lead to inconsistencies in the <span class="wrapper">data</span> such as in <span class="wrapper">survey etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial matching: <span class="wrapper">Links</span> datasets based on geographic location. <span class="wrapper">It’s</span> commonly used in services such as emergency response, where incidents need to be matched with the nearest available resource. For instance, emergency services can use spatial matching to dispatch the closest ambulance to a call based on location data.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Using techniques such as these ensures that otherwise disparate datasets can be effectively connected, helping to generate more consistent and actionable insights across an organisation’s data.</p>
