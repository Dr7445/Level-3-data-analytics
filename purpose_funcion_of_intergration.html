<h2>Explain the purpose and function of integration:</h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Data integration is the process of combining and unifying data from multiple sources so that it can be used for in-depth analysis, visualisation and to strengthen data-driven decisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Data is often collected from various sources, which can lead to it being in fragmented formats across an organisation's IT infrastructure that may not be compatible with one another, sources such as .CSV files, API's, spreadsheets (excel, google sheets) etc.<br /><br />This fragmentation of data can lead to degradation and inconsistencies and causing the formation of data silos (data that is separated within an organisation) making it difficult to extract for data analysis purposes and supports compliance with regulations such as GDPR.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of data integration is to eliminate this by ensuring data is efficiently gathered from its various sources and ensuring it is in a consistent structure that is suitable for data analysis. This leads to improved consistency in the data and enhances it for scalability, it enables for better collaboration between departments, deeper customer insights and improved decision making and operational efficiencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Functions of data integration include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ETL (Extract, transform, load): which is the process of extracting data from its various sources, transforming it ready for analysis by way of filtering, cleansing, organising and aggregating the data where necessary and loading the data in to its final resting place (data warehouses, data lakes etc) ready to be pulled as required for analysis.</li>
<li>Improved governance: Integration simplifies data governance through the unification of data sources and can make it easier to comply with GDPR.</li>
<li>Real-time data streaming: Integration can allow for the seamless streaming of real-time data if required enabling processes such as real-time updates of inventory levels for e-commerce companies.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Ultimately, data integration is a cornerstone of modern data architecture, enabling businesses to unlock insights, maintain compliance, and achieve strategic growth."</p>
