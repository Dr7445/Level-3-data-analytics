<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: medium;"><strong>Explain the methods of collecting datasets</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are several different methods that can be used to collect and compile datasets.<br /><br />These include API's (Application programming interface) which is a protocol that allows different applications to communicate with each other and allows developers to extract the data they require. As long as a website has an API that is accessible it's data can be extracted for collection.<br /><br />Another method and one that most people would commonly recognise is the importing and exporting of data. This can be achieved in a multitude of ways including manual extraction, importing and exporting of saved files, web scraping which allows large amounts of data to be extracted from websites in an automatic fashion and also with the use of API's as explained previously .<br /><br /><br />The other method of collecting datasets is via formats, formats are files that store semi-structured data, some examples being CSV. JSON. XML. SQL. XLSX etc.<br /><br />There are a variety of formats in which data can be collected including.<br /><br />Non- Proprietary - These are open standards that are decentralized and are publicly available for use, modification and distribution. These open datasets are typically formatted as CSV. JSON and XML files.<br /><br /><br />Unencrypted - Is data that is both stored or transmitted in it's original format without any encryption to conceal the content in the file. Tis allows anyone who gains access to the data to be able to access it without the need for security measures such as a key or a password.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /><br />Uncompressed - Uncompressed data is data that is stored in its full and original size. And whilst this means the data keeps of it's original content the files can be of considerable volume and may require additional storage space or bandwidth for transmission.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></p>
