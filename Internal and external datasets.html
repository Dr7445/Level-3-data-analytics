<p><em><strong>Internal and external dataset an explanation:</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In data there are 3 main types of datasets internal, external and open.</span><br /><br /><span>In this explanation we will explore what internal and external datasets are.<br /><br /><em><strong>Internal datasets:</strong></em></span><br /><br /><span>Internal datasets are collections of data that are produced internally and refer to the collection of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data that organisations accumulate from day to day.</span><br /><br /><span>Examples of these would include a customer database for a business or a patient database in a healthcare setting, these databases typically include various types of information that could help to improve customer services or patient waiting times/treatment and are what would be considered structured data that would fit neatly into rows and columns and would typically include data such as customer id. names, ages etc.</span><br /><br /><span>Semi-structured data would come from various sources that are searchable and could be scrapped or mined. Good examples of these would be social media posts, mentions and hashtags.</span><br /><br /><span>And finally, we have unstructured data which is typically data that would be difficult to organise in a structured manner such as image or videos with no accompanying metadata (which is data that gives us key pieces of information that would help to categorize the data, such as the creation date of the file, the author of the file etc.)</span><br /><span>Other examples of unstructured data would be text documents without specific quantifiable data such as reports , articles and letters.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>External datasets:</strong></em><br /><br /><span>External datasets are collections of data that come from external sources. These datasets are usually collected by third parties and have various purposes.</span><br /><br /><span>External datasets can come from a multitude of different sources, such as but not limited to government agencies, research institutions and social media platforms.</span><br /><br /><span>External datasets cover a wide range of topics and industries but can have some drawbacks such as the accuracy of the data, the reliability of where the sources of the data come from and the ability to be able to collate the data in a timely fashion. However they can give an organisation broader insights that they can use to compare against industry benchmarks, or social and economic indicators and market trends, patterns and behaviors.</span></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br /><br /><span>In summary internal datasets originate from an organization or an entities own activities and external datasets are collated from external sources and help to give a more broader and balanced context that wouldn't necessarily be gained from internal datasets alone.</span><br /><br /><span>In the world of data analytics both have a crucial role in an organisations data-driven decision making.</span></p>
