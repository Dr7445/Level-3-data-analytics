<h2>Evaluate the factors that impact the data architecture based on: • access requirements • security requirements</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Data architecture defines how data is collected, stored, processed and accessed in a data ecosystem. Two major components  that shape a data architecture<br />are its access requirements and its security requirements. Both of which can impact the design of the architecture.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Access Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>Data access requirements define who or what needs access to data, and how that access should be provided.</p>
<p>User access must be carefully managed through the use of roles and permissions. Different users such as analysts, managers, or developers require varying levels of access. It is therefore essential that the data architecture supports role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users can only access data that is relevant and authorised for their role.</p>
<p>Access types also influence the architecture. Some users may need access to real-time data for dashboards or monitoring, while others may only require batch data for periodic reports (e.g  end of day reports). This distinction determines whether the architecture should support real-time data streaming (e.g a streaming platorm such as confluent), or batch processing (e.g  using a data lake or warehouse).</p>
<p>Finally, the system must be scalable to accommodate varying levels of usage across an organisation. If a large number of users or systems need simultaneous access, this can be addressed by using cloud-based platforms.</p>

<p data-start="2089" data-end="2293">Security is of paramount importance to ensure that data remains protected from unauthorised access, corruption, or loss. There are several key factors that determine the security of the data architecture.</p>
<p data-start="2295" data-end="2554"><strong data-start="2295" data-end="2314">Data protection</strong> – The architecture must ensure that sensitive and confidential information is protected both in storage and in transit as it travels along data pipelines. This is often achieved through encryption or other security protocols such as HTTPS.</p>
<p data-start="2556" data-end="2874"><strong data-start="2556" data-end="2575">Access controls</strong> – Effective measures such as two-factor authentication, usernames, and strong passwords should be in place to ensure that data is only accessed by those authorised to use it. Identity management should be in place, and role-based permissions must be implemented from the outset of the architecture.</p>
<p data-start="2876" data-end="3260"><strong data-start="2876" data-end="2890">Monitoring</strong> – The architecture should be able to support the monitoring and logging of data access and any changes made to ensure that such activities are only carried out by those authorised to do so. Effective monitoring helps an organisation track unauthorised activity, maintain compliance and governance, and support forensic investigations if there is a breach in the system.</p>
<p data-start="3262" data-end="3527"><strong data-start="3262" data-end="3274">Recovery</strong> – The architecture must support backup, recovery, and have fail-safe mechanisms in place. This ensures that data can be quickly restored in the event of system failure or a security breach, minimising the overall impact to an organisation’s operations.</p>
